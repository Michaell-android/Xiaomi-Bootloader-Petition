# Xiaomi-Bootloader-Petition
Please stop requiring customers to perform China-only tests or submit China-specific "bootloader reports" in order to unlock devices â€” and accept legitimate international unlock requests without forcing extra, region-locked steps. This change will make unlock flows fairer, safer, and more practical for global users and third-party developers.
